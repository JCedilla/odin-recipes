    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Simply the best baked ziti recipe.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ pound hot Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>2 (24 ounce) jars prepared marinara sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package ziti pasta</li>
        <li>1 drizzle olive oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley, or to taste
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Procedure</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Cut down the length of each sausage with a sharp knife. <br> Remove and discard casings.</li> <br>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large saucepan set over high heat. Add sausages and onion. <br>
             Cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up with a spatula, until sausage begins <br>
             to brown, and onion turns translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add oregano, thyme, and rosemary<br>
              and cook for 1 minute more. </li> <br>
        <li>Pour in marinara sauce. Pour 1 cup water into each jar to rinse out remaining <br>
            sauce; add to the saucepan. Stir together and bring sauce to a simmer.</li> <br>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low, and let simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. <br>
            Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed. Turn off heat and reserve until needed. <br>
            Before using, skim any excess fat that rises to the surface.</li> <br>
        <li>While sauce simmers, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add <br>
            ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 or 2 minutes less than the directions on <br>
            the package call for, about 8 minutes. Drain well and transfer into a large mixing bowl.</li> <br>
        <li>Carefully add the meat sauce and stir until thoroughly combined. Let rest for 5 minutes. <br>
             Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large 9x15-inch or <br>
              9x13-inch casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil.</li> <br>
        <li>Use a slotted spoon to transfer half of the pasta and sauce mixture to the prepared dish, <br>
            then use a spatula to even out into a uniform layer. Top with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese, <br>
            1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, and then 1/2 of the grated Pecorino Romano cheese, being sure <br>
            to distribute evenly. Top with the rest of the pasta and sauce mixture and give the pan a little <br>
             shake to settle the sauce. Repeat the cheese application.</li> <br>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the <br>
             casserole is piping hot, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool <br>
              10 to 15 minutes before serving. Top with parsley.</li> <br>
    </ol>
